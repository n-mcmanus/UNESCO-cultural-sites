```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(sf)  # polygons
library(raster) #raster package
library(terra)  # newer/faster/better raster package

## Read in data

```{r}
# get italy from rnaturalearth data
world <- ne_countries(
  scale = "medium",
  returnclass = "sf"
)

# plot
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = world)
```



```{r}
# read in 5km resolution WDPA layer
wdpa <- rast("data/wdpa_5km_raster.tif")

# set desired crs to match wdpa layer
my_crs <- st_crs(wdpa)




# read in 5km resolution urban Chen data
urban <- rast("data/chen_urban_5km.tif") %>% 
  project(y = wdpa) # make urban and wdpa same crs




# read in cultural sites
unesco <- read_csv("data/whc-cultural-sites-2021.csv") %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
           crs = st_crs("epsg:4326")) %>% 
  st_transform(crs = my_crs) %>% 
  dplyr::select(name_en, area_hectares, states_name_en) %>% 
  mutate(ID = row_number()) # define id for joining later


plot(wdpa)
plot(urban, add = TRUE)
plot(unesco, col = "blue", add = TRUE)

```


## Define overlaps
### UNESCO + WDPA
```{r}
# vects play better with rasts (both are terra)
unesco_vect <- vect(unesco)

plot(wdpa)
plot(unesco_vect, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# use extract() to extract what's underneath points
wdpa_overlap <- terra::extract(
  # extract what's under the points in the raster
  x = wdpa,
  y = unesco_vect) %>% 
  
  rename(wdpa_overlap = 2) %>%  
  # rename second column to 'urban_overlap'
  
  mutate(wdpa_overlap = as.logical(wdpa_overlap)) %>% 
  # extract() outputs the values of the raster (or a summary thereof)
  # change to true/false 
  
  right_join(unesco, by = "ID") %>% 
  # the df from extract only contains ID numbers and raster values,
  # this joins the dataframe back up with the site names by linking the ID
  # numbers in the two tables
  
  dplyr::select(!c(geometry, ID)) %>% 
  # remove columns we don't care about
  
  relocate(name_en, .before = wdpa_overlap) %>%
  # move columns into desired order
  
  rename(country = states_name_en)
  # change column name

kable(wdpa_overlap) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "400px")
```


### UNESCO + Urban
```{r}
plot(urban)
plot(unesco_vect, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
```

```{r}
urban_overlap <- terra::extract(x = urban, y = unesco_vect) %>% 
  rename(urban_overlap = 2) %>% 
  mutate(urban_overlap = as.logical(urban_overlap)) %>% 
  right_join(unesco, by = "ID") %>% 
  dplyr::select(!c(geometry, ID)) %>% 
  relocate(name_en, .before = urban_overlap) %>% 
  rename(country = states_name_en)

kable(urban_overlap) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "400px")
```

## Combine

```{r}
overlaps <- wdpa_overlap %>% 
  left_join(urban_overlap, by = c("name_en", "area_hectares", "country")) %>% 
  # could also probably do `by=NULL` for same result (easier if more matching variables)
  
  relocate(urban_overlap, .before = area_hectares)

kable(overlaps) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped") %>% 
  scroll_box(height = "400px")
```

## Filter for sites of interest

Now, we want to return only cultural heritage sites that do not overlap with either the urban or WDPA *and* are over 100ha in size

```{r}
overlaps_select <- overlaps %>% 
  filter()
```
